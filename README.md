# Summer Code - VS Code theme
![Summer Code Logo](https://github.com/cmion/summercode-vscode/raw/master/./summer.png)


## Installation
To begin with, [install the base theme from the VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cmion.summercode-vscode). This is the way Summer Code is intended to be used day-to-day.. 

Summer Code currently has 2 background types. Summer Code Palenight and Summer Code


### Font
I haven't included a font in this release as I know that it's a very personal preference. The font I use (that is seen in the image above) is [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), which I recommend if you're a fan of ligatures.

## Compatibility
This theme is **very much a work in progress**. I primarily develop in HTML & CSS, JS, React and Python so, whilst those language sets should look pretty good, there will likely be issues for other languages. I'll work on adding more support as I go. If you find anything glaringly wrong, raise an issue and I'll try to fix it as soon as I can.


## Contributing
I'm really happy to consider any contributions to this theme. Before you make any changes, [please read the contribution guide](https://github.com/cmion/summercode-vscode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Thanks
Lastly, I couldn't have made this if it weren't for the fantastic work of [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo). Her [tutorial on theming for CSS tricks](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/) was a huge help in developing this üôè

Similarly, I'd like to thanks [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) for his [cool Cobalt2 theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode). His readme helped me figure out how to package this hot mess for public use üëç
